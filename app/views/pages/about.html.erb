  <div id="biography">
    <p>Thanks for visiting my application. Who am I? My name is Cole Faloon. I'm a software engineer and web application developer living in Durham, NC. I like music, games, software development and high functioning teams.
    </p>
    <p>Over the past several years I have been a part of two start-up teams. I have learned the hard way the benefits of "best practices" including but not limited to ample test coverage, continuous integration, style guidelines, and peer review.
    </p>
    <p>Agile development practices orient my decision making. Well groomed specifications coupled with incremental deliveries backed by tests keep everyone happy. That includes stakeholders, managers, developers and customers.
