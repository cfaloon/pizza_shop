Pizza Shop
===

Pizza Shop is a web application for a fictional pizza shop, which was inspired by a conversation with a local business owner and his frustration with the service he currently uses. This application allows a user to place an order with the fictional brick-and-mortar establishment. Orders and their status can be viewed by the user, and administrators can see and update the status of ALL orders. This application is intended to be a demonstration of my familiarity with Rails and application development.

A live deployment of this application can be found [here.](http://cfaloon-pizza-shop.herokuapp.com)
